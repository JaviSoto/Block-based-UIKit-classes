#Description:
Subclasses of frequently used UIKit classes to be able to use them by passing a callback block instead of having to implement the delegate method for more readable code.
You also have some + show methods to be able to achieve the whole functionality in just one call.

#Included classes:
+ JSBlocksActionSheet
+ JSBlocksAlertView
+ JSBlocksBarButtonItem
+ JSBlocksButton

#Sample usage:
```objective-c
#import "JSBlocksAlertView.h"
[JSBlocksAlertView showAlertViewWithTitle:@"title" message:@"message" dismissedCallback:^(JSBlocksAlertView *alertView, int buttonIndex) {
	// callback logic
} cancelButtonTitle:@"cancel" otherButtonTitles: nil];
```

For the rest, refer to the .h files
